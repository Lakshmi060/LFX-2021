## Introduction

This is the project report for **Cloud native measurement, reporting and validation of carbon emissions** which was completed during Linux Foundation Mentorship Fall Term 2021. The status of the project can be regarded as complete due to the fact that all pull requests have been merged and all the initial premises of the project have been fulfilled.

## Acknowledgments

I am deeply grateful to my mentors [Andrew O'Reilly-Nugent](https://github.com/aornugent) and [Gopinath Balakrishnan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bgopi). I would also express my gratitude towards [Arnav Tiwari](https://github.com/arnav-t), [Harsh Bardhan Mishra](https://github.com/HarshCasper), [Mohammad Warid](https://github.com/waridrox), [Shloka Gupta](https://github.com/chicken-biryani) and [Shubham Karande](https://github.com/shubhamkarande13). Mentors guided me patiently through the project and were always ready to help, review work in progress, gave feedback regarding the overall shape of the project and the feasibility of certain solutions, and maintained a very friendly, supportive, and stimulating atmosphere on the team. They devoted a lot of time to this project and led the video meetings in a well-organized, yet non-stressful manner. Their support and positivity helped me through this project and made me enjoy every bit of it. The project could not be completed without the generous feedback and help from the team. Last but not least, I would like to thank The Linux Foundation for this initiative.
